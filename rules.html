                <h1 class="tbp_title">Rules &#038; Guidelines</h1>
                <p>Vivid Horizon staff reserve the right to enforce the below rules and policies at their discretion. Violating these rules may result in warnings or&mdash;for more serious breaches&mdash;a potential permanent ban from the server.</p>
                <p>Any attempt to cheat, whether through external tools, unauthorised third-party software, in-game exploits or internal services is not tolerated and will be met with disciplinary action.</p>
                <p>All disciplinary decisions made by staff can be appealed, however after your appeal is brought to staff the decision here is final.</p>
                
                <h2>General Rules</h2>
                <p>All players must be at least 18 years old.</p>
                <p>Please ensure you have a good quality microphone to optimise the roleplay experience for everyone involved.</p>
                <p>No toxic behavior. Intentional disruption of gameplay, including trolling, griefing or stream-sniping is not permitted. Players are expected to maintain a positive and respectful demeanor at all times.</p>

                <h2>Respect and inclusion</h2>
                <p>All players must be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
                
                <h3>No Discrimination</h3>
                <p>Discrimination in all forms is strictly prohibited, including but not limited to: racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, religion, threats of violence and any form of hate speech.</p>

                <h3>Consent is key</h3>
                <p>Public Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is strictly prohibited, as it can make others uncomfortable. Please always ensure that all involved parties constent to roleplay scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Fair Play & Roleplay Integrity</h2>
                <h3>RP is RP</h3>
                <p>What happens in the server stays in the server. You are playing a character, so whatever happens to your character is directed solely towards your character and should not be considered as personal out of character.</p>

                <h3>Value Your Life</h3>
                <p>You should value your life as a character at all times. If you are clearly outnumbered, being held at gunpoint or in any other way at an obvious disadvantage, you should comply with the demands made of you.</p>

                <h3>No Metagaming</h3>
                <p>Using out-of-character information to influence in-character decisions or actions is not allowed under any circumstances.</p>

                <h3>No Powergaming</h3>
                <p>Unrealistic actions or forcing outcomes onto other players that bypass organic roleplay scenarios are prohibited.</p>

                <h3>New Life Rule</h3>
                <p>If you bleed out, i.e. your bleed out counter reaches zero, you will still remember everyone and everything about your life, but nothing about the events leading up to your death. If there are witnesses, they <strong>can</strong> tell you what happened but you will have no personal memory of the event(s).</p>
                
                <h3>Character Permadeath</h3>
                <p>Permanently deceased characters cannot be revived without explicit administrative approval. Players must honor character deaths deemed permanent as part of the roleplay.</p>

                <h3>Fear Roleplay</h3>
                <p>Players must act realistically in life-threatening situations. For example, compliance with demands when held at gunpoint is required to maintain immersion.</p>

                <h2>Combat & Crime Regulations</h2>

                <h3>No Combat Logging</h3>
                <p>Force logging out during combat to avoid consequences is strictly prohibited.</p>


                <h3>No Random Deathmatch (RDM)</h3>
                <p>Attacking or killing other players without valid in-character reasoning is strictly prohibited. All violent actions must be supported by roleplay justification.</p>

                <h3>No Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM)</h3>
                <p>Using vehicles to harm other players without appropriate roleplay justification is not allowed.</p>

                <h3>No PD/EMS Baiting</h3>
                <p>Please do not deliberately provoke law enforcement or emergency medical services with legitimate roleplay reasons. Gangs should remember that law enforcement have superior resources.</p>

                <h3>Criminal activity before server restarts</h3>
                <p>No petty criminal activity should be initated when the time reaches 15 minutes before a server restart.</p>
                <p>No major criminal activity should be initiated when the time reaches 30 minutes before a server restart.</p>

                <h2>Server/Community Rules</h2>

                <h3>Avoid Sensitive Topics</h3>
                <p>Discussions regarding real-world politics or religion are not permitted in global or OOC chat to maintain a harmonious environment.</p>

                <h3>Prohibited Content</h3>
                <p>The sharing of graphic, offensive, or illegal content is strictly forbidden. Violations will result in immediate disciplinary action, potentially including bans.</p>

                <h3>No Spamming</h3>
                <p>Flooding chat or voice channels with repetitive, unnecessary, or disruptive messages or noises is not allowed.</p>

                <h3>Compliance with legal standards</h3>
                <p>The server must not be used for real-world illegal activities, such as account trading or sharing pirated materials.</p>

                 
                <h3>Compliance with legal standards</h3>
                <p>The server must not be used for real-world illegal activities, such as account trading or sharing pirated materials.</p>

                <h3>Voice and Chat Conduct</h3>
                <p>Clear and respectful communication is mandatory during roleplay interactions. Excessive swearing or disruptive noises will not be tolerated.</p>
